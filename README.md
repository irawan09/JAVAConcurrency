# JAVA Concurrency
Since Java is a multi-threaded programming language, we can use it to create multi-threaded programs. A multi-threaded program is made up of two or more portions that can operate in parallel, each of which can tackle a distinct task at the same time, maximizing the use of available resources, especially when your computer has several CPUs.
Multitasking is defined as the sharing of common processing resources, such as a CPU, by many processes. Multi-threading extends the concept of multitasking into programs by allowing you to divide certain operations within a single app into several threads. Each thread can execute in its own thread. Not only does the operating system split processing time among distinct apps, but it also divides it among each thread within an application.
Multi-threading allows you to code in a way that allows numerous threads to run at the same time.
