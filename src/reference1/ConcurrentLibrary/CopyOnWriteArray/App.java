     * CopyOnWriteArrayList can be used as a thread-safe alternative to ArrayList,
     * with additional methods addIfAbsent() and addAllAbsent() that append elements
     * if they are not contained in the list. A CopyOnWriteArrayList makes a new copy of its elements
     * for every write operation and its iterator holds a different copy (snapshot) so
     * it enables sequential writes and concurrent reads: only one thread can execute write
     * operation and multiple threads can execute read operations at the same time.
     * And its iterator doesnâ€™t throw ConcurrentModification.
